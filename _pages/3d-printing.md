<p>The future is here...growing up watching sci-fi shows where they just told a machine to make a part, that's how I feel every time I print something.  About a year ago, I got an Anet A6 from some after Christmas sale.  I'd love to say that right out of the box it was amazing.  It wasn't, but I had done my research and the best advice I went with was "it's a hobby and a new skill".  So I knew going in that I was going to be awful and I was.  it took me a good 6 months before I got any decent prints.  There's a lot of tweaking and tons of learning to do.  I'll go more in depth later, but I wanted to put this topic up.  Here is a time lapse of a lock pinning tray I printed right at the year mark of having the printer.</p>
