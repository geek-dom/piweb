<p>So I really need to get on the ball and update my pets page.  Tons have happened with the aquariums.  We have baby guppies, mollies, and tons of mystery snails.  My wife and her mom are very involved in 4-H and my wife met a family with a daughter (Elli) that might just surpass me with a passion on aquariums.  Just a bit of background, I have 1 tank that exploded in guppies and mystery snails.  We went over to her house last week and I gave her a dozen or so snails.  Super grateful and she really knows her stuff.  Her favorite color is purple.  So when baby snails are born, you can't tell their color.  Color really comes in around 2-3 months....even with their body.  You have the pure colors (Ivory, Blue, Jade Green) and then you have snails with those black stripes...black stripes mean they come from some lineage of "wild".  Wild gives us Black and Magenta and Purple.  Purple or Magenta is a lesser color...but if  you get a Purple/Magenta with no black stripes, that like the golden ticket.  I now have 2 of those.  So, Elli, this is tracking your purple snail.  I just found it today.</p>
