<p>What is it and why do I use it?  Ansible is an open source super tool.  It helps automate change management, configurations, and deployments.  It works for Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft.  I have around a dozen Raspberry Pi's and when I make a change, I don't want to have to touch each one.  With ansible, once I have the final config I want all my RPi's to have (host files, ssh keys, custom login screen, etc) ansible will connect to each one and make the changes.  I even use it to run updates on all the RPi's.  I forgot to make a video of the update playbook, but I will make it as soon as I get a chance.  The first video is basic install and some basic commands.  The second video go a bit more in depth.</p>
