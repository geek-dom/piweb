<p>So have you gotten a call from a local town...your extended warranty, IRS, or other BS.  It's a scam.  You might even have clicked on a website and got a pop up that you need to call for support.  It's mostly from call centers out of India motivated to take your money.  My pop recently got a call asking him to verify his info and they would tell him about something, but they wouldn't say any specifics.  There are groups and individuals out there taking them on.  Search youtube for Jim Browning or Malcom Merlin.  The ultimate prevention is knowledge.  Please share this with everyone.<br><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNG0osIBAprVcZZ3ic84vw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNG0osIBAprVcZZ3ic84vw</a> </p>
