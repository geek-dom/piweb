<p>**Preface to Geeks reading this**<br>Geeks, you have a gift...the gift of understanding technology.  That gift could be natural ability, the ability to read a manual and apply it, the ability to search for the knowledge, or the combination of all these.  To modify the saying, with tech powers, comes some responsibilities.  Patience - My philosophy is a 3 to 5 rule...I try to keep patient the first 3 to 5 times I answer the same question, explain something, or fix the same problem/item.  Everyone has limits, but please keep kindness in your heart as you help the non-Geeks of the world.</p>

<p>Everyone knows someone in their life that can be cool enough to be part of Geek-Dom.  One of the earliest jobs I had in my home growing up was setting the clocks on microwaves, VCR's, and any other digital clock because of power outages, new devices, or day light savings.  This evolved into connecting and fixing anything home entertainment system.  This was the path of my becoming the family Geek.<br><br>In today's technological culture, technology is a basic part of many every day things, but not every can or will keep up with using that technology.  Technology isn't perfect (sorry Apple users, Mac and iPhones/iPads have loads of issues also).  In the past, you had to have a good doctor, mechanic, and lawyer.  Now, Geek seems to be a more essential addition to that list.  Anything worthy of falling in the Geek-Dom domain seems to have it's own languages and rules that can be confusing for those not down with the Geek so please keep reading as I try to make a bridge of understanding and explain the Geek view and way of life and ways to be more understanding and appreciate of those technological saviors in your life.<br><br>We ask questions and tons of them as part of troubleshooting.  Even with my years of experience, I don't know the exact answer to your exact issue based on what you are experiencing or telling me.  We Geeks are very good at translating "something isn't working" into a troubleshooting path, diagnosis, and hopefully a solution.  We ask because we are trying to help...if we weren't, we would tell you first thing we don't know to get rid of you.<br><br>Myth and misconceptions<br>This will be a hard pill to swallow, but we need to clear up a few things that are total bunk<br><br>False<br><br><strong>The Cloud</strong><br>It doesn't exist.  They sell it like this magical thing that exists in the heavens....it doesn't.  It's just storing you info on someone else's equipment.  Google has server (mega computers) in the Midwest, south, and west.  In the most basic terms, you are storing your files on your friends computer.<br><br><strong>It has a power cord or connects to the internet so we must know</strong><br>Totally false... You have a device that runs on some power...be it computer, phone, tablet, drone, etc.  Let me ask you... You can get in a vessel that has an engine and runs-aka your car.  So applying non-Geek to Geek expectations...it has an engine and controls...then you can operate anything with an engine and controls.  Drive manual transmission, diesel, anything that has an engine and control...planes, trains, and automobiles.  Sounds stupid, right...  But that is what is expected of Geeks...it's a device with power and maybe internet, so then we must be experts.  If you have a heart condition do you go to a   proctologist?  Either of those have had way more college than me.   Those of us that are good with technology get the burden of being expected to know everything.  We are damn good, but now omnipresence. <br><br>So with those out of the way, please keep reading.<br><br><strong>Have you rebooted/Have you tried turning it off and on again</strong><br>This has become cliche, joke, and frustrating question to non-Geeks, but it is a serious troubleshooting question.  As a life long Geek and an IT (Information Technology - professional Geek) Administrator I have asked this question thousands of times...why?  Because of experience.  During my years of working for a help desk, this solved at least 60% of all problems users called in with.  Why?  Have you ever had a head ache or tummy ache and took a nap, then woke up feeling better?  It's the same with electronics, a lot of times some mundane task on a computer (say being impatient when Word doesn't immediately open when you double click on the icon and 30-40 clicks on the icon bring the computer to a halt) creates a bottleneck in the system.  So just like when you rest after the mundane task of eating something that doesn't agree with you helps your tummy, rebooting your computer gives it a temporary nap and clears a lot of problems up.  So keep this in mind the next time you're asked...and if you say you have rebooted when you haven't - shame shame on you!<br><br><strong>What were you doing when (insert problem) happened/When did this start</strong><br>We don't ask you this tell you that you did something wrong or stupid...it's all part of troubleshooting.  Were you cleaning around your desk and now your monitor doesn't work...so maybe a cable came loose.  The power went off and after it came back on, your computer won't power on...maybe the breaker in your surge protector (because we always use those, right?) tripped and you just need to push the reset button.  We weren't there when the issue occurred so you are our eyes, ears, hands, and recording of the events and most of the time you are talking to us is over the phone so we can't look at things ourselves.<br><br><strong>Why is this happening/What's wrong/It's not working right</strong><br>That is a fully loaded question.  What's happening, what's wrong and what is right?  Let me begin.  In my house, I have 1 dell tower pc, 1 lenovo laptop, 1 macbook, 1 mac-mini, 1 nas (network attached storage) 9 Raspberry Pi's, 2 network printers, multiple UPS (battery backups), my wife's laptop, 4-H laptop, printers, NEST and Amazon devices...and yet, I have no clue about your "it's not working".  Tell me about it.  I have an answer...it can be either "I don't know...no clue" or "what device"....it all depends on how honest you are or how much you answer or listen"...sorry again, Geeks are a resource, but it's up to you to access us.<br><br><br></p>
