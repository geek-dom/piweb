<p>What are they and why do them.  Mandalas have roots in Hinduism and Buddhism.  They are complex patterns that were originally created to depict one's journey through life.  Religion is one of those hot topics and that's not my point here.  Mandalas have become popular as stress relievers.  It may sound silly to color as an adult, but it really is therapeutic.   There are a ton of downloadable pages on the InterWeb, just google "mandala coloring". <br><br>How to do Mandala Meditation...  That's a personal journey.  There are tons of sites telling you how to color them...for me, I throw that right out the window.  When I take out a blank Mandala, I just take a few moments to look at it and let my mind wonder.  The colors start to come to me and I color.  I don't worry about staying in the lines or if this color goes with that one.  I just let it flow.  The coloring becomes secondary, but it helps me direct what's going on in my mind.<br><br>So sales pitch aside, here's some info and some of the Mandalas from my collection.  I use color pencils, but you can use whatever you like.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala</a><br><br><a href="http://spiritualawakening.weebly.com/mandalas-what-are-they.html">http://spiritualawakening.weebly.com/mandalas-what-are-they.html</a><br><br><a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/free-mandala-coloring-pages-4027232">https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/free-mandala-coloring-pages-4027232</a><br><br>My personal collection<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qGeinKdgEddO3r_cpTuHL27xjtGkZLQQ?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qGeinKdgEddO3r_cpTuHL27xjtGkZLQQ?usp=sharing</a></p>
