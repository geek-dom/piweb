<p>I've had a few aquariums in my life.  Nothing every really fancy.  When my wife said that she wanted an aquarium little did I know that I would get hooked on the hobby.  We started off with with a 36 gallon curved tank.  We had lots of failures until we really started researching and doing things right.  Somewhere along the way, I got hooked on Mystery Snails.  They are fun to watch.</p>
