<p>Our pets are a huge part of our lives (sometimes more than we want).  I am fortunate enough to have an amazing wife that loves animals.  We are mainly a kitty and aquarium home...and something that is classified as a dog.<br><br><a href="https://geek-dom.com/pets/kitties/">Kitties</a><br><br><a href="https://geek-dom.com/pets/aquatics/">Aquariums</a></p>

<p>The only pets that we have bought are the ones in our aquariums.  We have taken in strays and adopted.  I want to take a moment and talk about shelters.  Humane society and shelters aren't just sad places that dogs get locked up in like we see in the movies.  A lot of dedicated people help and volunteer.  My wife does an amazing job at getting food donations our our local shelters.  Our youngest cat, Frank, was at a place called the RiverKittyCafe that showcased cats from the local humane society.  The one that we got Frank from didn't just have cats and dogs...they have rabbits, snakes, lizards, and more.  If you're looking for a new pet, someplace to volunteer at or donate to...check them out.</p>

<p>We've upped our game.  We now have 2 36-37 gallon tanks up and cycled.  We haven't decided what to do with the 5 gallon one that we were using for an emergency tank.  I'd like to get that setup as a Beta tank for my wife.</p>
