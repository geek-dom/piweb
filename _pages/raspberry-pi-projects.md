<p>This started off as goofing around figuring out what to do with all my raspberry pi's (RPi's) and it took on it's own life.  I hope to use this to help others wanting to do similar projects and save time and headaches with all the contradicting and confusing information out there.  I'm an IT professional and a lot of what's out there confused the heck out of me.  If there is a specific project that you're having problems with, please email me (<a href="mailto:don@geek-dom.com">don@geek-dom.com</a>) and I'll see what I can dig up.<br><br><img class="wp-image-34" style="width: NaNpx;" src="https://geek-dom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleDrive_20190314_211825.jpg" alt=""></p>
