<p>In this video, I will demonstrate how to setup a new Raspberry Pi in Headless mode.  So what the heck is that?  Headless mode is running a Raspberry Pi without a monitor, keyboard, and mouse connected.  This is done by creating 2 files on the SD card while it's connected to your computer.  This will show you how to configure your wifi and enable SSH all before inserting the SD card in to your Raspberry Pi for the first time.</p>
