<p>Git is a version control system.  It's mostly used for version control for software code.  When you sync with Git, it creates a respository.  Each time you make a change and sync again, the changes are tracked.  This is useful if you need to go back to any previous changes made.  Git is not just useful for code, but other things.  I use it for ansible scripts, but also documentation.  GitLab and GitHub are online versions of git.  These are handy and don't require installing much on your part, but keep in mind that what you post to them are not private.  GitLab offers a free local version for you to install and use.</p>
