<p>My whole life, I've had dogs and no cats.  A few years back a pregnant momma cat showed up and that began my entrance into the world of cats.  Now, before the battle of Dog Lovers and Cat Lovers begins, I love dogs, but as I've gotten older, I just don't have the time or patience of training them anymore.  Cats come pretty much trained from the get go.  Just show them where food, water, and litter box are.  So </p>

<p>Lily is our only female and part of the litter the momma cat had.  She has a cute face, but won't just lay down in bed when we got to sleep...always moving!  She got booted from the house for over a year because she went through dozens of cords (no phone chargers alone, but xbox cords) and using our bar as a scratching post. And she doesn't like the other cats much...not even her brother, Lucky.</p>

<p>Lucky is the other remaining cat from the litter.  He's the old man of the group and our biggest cat (I swear he's got some Maine Coon in him).  He doesn't like to socialize with the other cats.  If he's in the house, he's usually asleep on our bed or on top of the kitchen cabinets.  For his size, he's got a mouse of a meow (Think Hana Mae Lee girl from pitch perfect).</p>

<p>One day, I went out the side door and there was this tiny kitten meowing at me from our shed.  This guy fit in the palm of my hand.  After a visit to vet to clear up some mud butt issues, he quickly joined the family.  He truly fits his namesake of Dude.  For the most part he is very chill.  He has the best kitty smell and the softest fur.  We don't know where he came from, but we're glad he found our house and decided to take us in.</p>

<p>So little bit of a back story with our newest cat, Frank.  My wife and her friends went out for a girls' night and ended up at The River Kitty Cafe, which is a great place that showcases adoptable cats from the local Humane Society (<a href="https://www.riverkittycatcafe.com/">https://www.riverkittycatcafe.com/)</a> .  My wife texted me that she was there, so I pulled up the live cam for the Cafe and was able to see them playing with the cats.  She fell in love with one kitty, named Daffy Duck.  I went to town early one day and went to see him for myself.  My plan was to surprise her with bringing him home.  As soon as I walked in, he came running up to me.  I knew he would be coming home, but I did make sure with my wife first.  He is super snugly and very talkative.  When he talks to us, he sounds like a cat version of Chewie.  He and Dude have become best buds.  Dude was always trying to play with the other cats, but they didn't want any.  These two kitties really scrap it out.</p>
