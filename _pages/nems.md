<p>NEMS Linux is the Nagios Enterprise Monitoring Server for Single Board Computers.  In my IT career, I have used Nagios in many environments and this is truly the easiest and most robust take on it.  Developed by Robbie Ferguson, it is an active project with a ton of bells and whistles.  I plan on doing several tutorials on NEMS, so stay tuned.</p>
