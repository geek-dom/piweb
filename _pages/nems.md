<p>NEMS Linux is the Nagios Enterprise Monitoring Server for Single Board Computers.  In my IT career, I have used Nagios in many environments and this is truly the easiest and most robust take on it.  Developed by Robbie Ferguson, it is an active project with a ton of bells and whistles.  I plan on doing several tutorials on NEMS, so stay tuned.<br><br><a href="http://NEMSLinux.com">NEMSLinux.com</a><br><a href="https://docs.nemslinux.com/">Documentation</a><br>If you like and use NEMS, please consider becoming a Patron and supporting it<br><a href="https://www.patreon.com/nems">Become a Patron</a><br></p>
