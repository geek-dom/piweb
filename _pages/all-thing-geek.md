<p>Welcome to my page.  I'm an OSG...Old School Geek.  Yep, I was the kid that got beat up for reading comics and LOTR before it became pop culture.  I'm an IT professional with a wide range of hobbies including tech, cars, and the Ukulele.  I hope you find something helpful here.  If there is something I can explain or do a demo of, please let me know.<br><br>BTW, this site is running on Wordpress on a Raspberry PI from my home.  Good Stuff!!!</p>
