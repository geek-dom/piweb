<p>When I got my Cloudlet cluster box for my RPi's the instructions said to power the fans off of the RPi's...well, why go with the flow (see what I did there?).  So I did a quick interweb search on the google machine and did something a bit different.  I took a bread board, a USB chord, some jumper wires, and my trusty solder iron.</p>

<p>To begin with I grabbed a spare usb cable and clipped it off.  There are 4 wires and the ones needed for power are the red (positive) and black (negative/ground).  The other 2 wires are for data, which I didn't need for this. </p>

<p>I mounted the bread board in my handy, dandy soldering stand.</p>

<p>I then used jumper wires for the positive and negative sides.  Once the soldering was good, I connected them to the fans.</p>

<p>I mounted the bread board to one of the Cloudlet inserts.  Now the fans run and I can use the RPi's pins for other things.</p>
